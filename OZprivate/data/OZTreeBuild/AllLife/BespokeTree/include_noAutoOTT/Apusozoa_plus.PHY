[Here I collect a variety of obscure eukaryotes that seem to fall as sister groups to the Opisthokonts. OpenTree 6.1 has Collodictyonidae as the only group in "Apusozoa". I place this group in the Amoebozoa instead, as per https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1420657112 .

In the Apusozoa, I put Ancyromonadida, Nutomonas, and Planomonadidaeas as per https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejop.2012.08.007 . The branching order is pretty arbitrary. This will almost certainly need to be revised when new versions of the OpenTree emerge.

note that negative branch lengths signify partial display of branches (signifying uncertainty)
