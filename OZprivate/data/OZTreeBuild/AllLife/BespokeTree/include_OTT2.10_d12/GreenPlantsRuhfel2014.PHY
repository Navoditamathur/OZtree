[OpenTree 6.1 has a very messy polytomy at the base of Chloroplastida (Green Plants) (NB: expanding Chloroplastida_ott361838 to depth 42 gives about 30,000 spp). In particular, most Chlamydomonas species have percolated to the top of the phylogeny. Until this is resolved, we have to hand-code our way around it, as follows 

Here, I mostly follow Ruhfel et al (2014) https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-14-23 who have a basal dichotomy into Streptophyta & Chlorophyta. The Streptophytes (ott916750) are most plants, including land plants. In OpenTree 6.1 they show a basal trichotomy including the Klebsormidiophyceae. These are placed by Wickett (2014: http://www.pnas.org/content/111/45/E4859) as the second branch to diverge from Streptophytes, after the Chlorokybophyceae/Mesostigmatophyceae branch, i.e.

(Chlorophyta,((Klebsormidiophyceae_ott372052@,Streptophyta_minus_first_2_branches__ott~916750-372052-897408-930075@40),(Chlorokybophyceae_ott897408@,Mesostigmatophyceae_ott930075@))Streptophyta_ott916750)Chloroplastida_ott361838

The Chlorophyta are much more tricky. They are absent from the synthetic tree (presumed paraphyletic), although they do have an OTT: 979501. Here we reinstate them. The include most of the genera etc. present in the Chloroplastid polytomy. A relatively comprehensive tree is seen in Fucikova etc al (2014:
http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fevo.2014.00063/full#F1), but this doesn't seem to have made it into the synth tree yet.

For the moment, therefore, we just bung in all these into one huge Chlorophyta polytomy labelled with OTT:979501, Chlorophyta_ott979501~361838-916750
