[Here I collect a variety of obscure eukaryotes that seem to fall as sister groups to the Opisthokonts. OpenTree 6.1 has Collodictyonidae as the only group in "Apusozoa". I place this group in the Amoebozoa instead, as per http://www.pnas.org/content/112/7/E693.abstract.

In the Apusozoa, I put Ancyromonadida, Nutomonas, and Planomonadidaeas as per http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23369787. The branching order is pretty arbitrary. This will almost certainly need to be revised when new versions of the OpenTree emerge.

note that negative branch lengths signify non-display of branches
