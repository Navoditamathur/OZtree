[Example file that grafts a Pongo phylogeny from OpenTree onto a great ape backbone, and
adds domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) as a unary node below Canis lupus.

NOTES:

* Grafting is done with the '@' sign. Note that the instructions in 
    OZprivate/ServerScripts/TreeBuild/README.markdown assume that phylogeny files 
    which graft parts of the opentree are saved with an uppercase `.PHY` extension. 

* In the example below, the Homo/Pan/Gorilla split is set as a trichotomy, 
    for demonstration purposes.

* To force a name to have a particular ott, but not graft a subtree, the ott number 
    can be added without an '@' sign (as shown below with Homo_sapiens and Gorilla).

* Additional files (e.g. my_subphylogeny.phy) are conventionally grafted into the tree 
    by including a name followed by an "@" sign, (e.g. "MY_INCLUDE_NAME@"), then 
    specifying the filename in the Life_full_tree_start.js file, e.g.

   $tree.substitute('MY_INCLUDE_NAME@', 'BespokeTree/include_files/my_subphylogeny.phy');

* As shown below, the last line of this comment field can specify a context, to help when
    mapping scientific names to Open Tree IDs. Valid contexts to use are listed at 
    https://github.com/OpenTreeOfLife/opentree/wiki/Open-Tree-of-Life-APIs#contexts.
