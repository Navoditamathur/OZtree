Your OneZoom sponsorship of {{=XML(species_name)}} has gone live

Dear {{=XML(username)}},

Thank you so much for your donation to OneZoom. This will help us in our aim to
provide easy access to scientific knowledge about biodiversity and evolution,
and raise awareness about the variety of life on earth together with the need
to conserve it.

We are very pleased to be able to tell you that your sponsored leaf,
{{=XML(the_species)}}, has now appeared on the tree decorated with your sponsorship
details.

It’s now there for all to see at:

  {{=URL('life/@=%s' % ott, url_encode=False, scheme=True, host=True)}}

or, if you’d like to fly through the tree to your sponsored leaf try 

  {{=URL('life/@=%s' % ott, vars=dict(init='zoom'), url_encode=False, scheme=True, host=True)}}

There’s also the more obvious link

  onezoom.org/life/@{{=XML(species_name.replace(" ","_"))}}

but this may be less stable (for example sometimes two very different creatures
on the tree share the same scientific name, so you may end up going to the
wrong place).

Please consider sharing the link with your friends and family!

We welcome your feedback and are always keen to find ways to make OneZoom better.

Thank you again for your donation, we hope you enjoy exploring our tree of life.
