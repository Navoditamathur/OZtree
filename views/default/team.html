        <p><a href="http://www.rosindell.org" target="_blank">James Rosindell</a> is a research fellow at Imperial College London where he holds a Natural Environment Research Council independent research fellowship. His area of research interest, biodiversity theory, is focused on the area of intersection between maths, biology and computing. He has published research around models of ecology, evolution, conservation and data-visualisation. James is the original inventor of OneZoom and wrote the early versions of the software. He co-wrote versions 2 and 3 of OneZoom and is especially responsible for client side JavaScript code as well as day to day running of the charity.</p>

        <p><a href="http://www.biologie.ens.fr/phyloeco/index.html" target="_blank">Hélène Morlon</a> is a researcher at the French national center for scientific researcher (CNRS). After training in mathematics, she obtained a master in ecology and a PhD in environmental sciences. During five years as a postdoc in the US, she developed a deep interest in biodiversity research. She currently leads an interdisciplinary team of young researchers at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris focused on understanding how the deep-time evolution of biodiversity led to life around us as we see it today. Hélène is a 2016 TED Fellow. Since joing the OneZoom team as an ambassador, Hélène has been working to raise awareness around OneZoom and help us form links.</p>

        <p><a href="https://yanwong.me" target="_blank">Yan Wong</a> is an evolutionary biologist with wide-ranging expertise including maths, genetics and computing. He worked as a lecturer in evolutionary biology and ecology at the University of Leeds before moving into professional science outreach. As an author, Yan co-authored the Ancestor's Tale (2016) with Richard Dawkins. His work has included presenting on numerous television and radio science shows including the BBC1 prime-time series "Bang goes the theory", BBC learning zome films and Radio 4's' 'More or less'. Yan co-wrote the OneZoom version 2 and 3 codebase and was especially responsible for server-side and data scraping software.</p>

        <h2>Kai Zhong</h2>
        <p>Software Developer</p>
        <img width = "95%" style = "margin:10px"src= "{{=URL('static','images/Team/Kai.png')}}" alt="">
        <p>Kai Zhong is a freelance software developer. He graduated from Imperial College London in 2013 with a distinction in computer science at masters level. His main project was an Android app for OneZoom which was supervised by James Rosindell and Duncan Gillies. He went on to work with James Rosindell to produce <a href="http://www.zoompast.org" target="_blank">ZoomPast</a> a human family tree (Genealogy) website based on the OneZoom concept. Kai has primarily been working on upgrading the OneZoom engine to enable it to handle visualisation of the complete tree of life.</p>
