                    <p>Kai Zhong graduated from Imperial College London in 2013 with a distinction in computer science at masters level. His main project was an Android app for OneZoom which was supervised by James Rosindell and Duncan Gillies. He went on to work with James Rosindell to produce <a href="http://www.zoompast.org" target="_blank">ZoomPast</a> a human family tree (Genealogy) website based on the OneZoom concept. Kai has primarily been working on upgrading the OneZoom engine to enable it to handle visualisation of the complete tree of life. Kai Zong worked as a freelance software developer on the OneZoom project in 2016 and 2017 working on the release of versions 3.0 and 3.1. Kai now works as a professional software developer in China.</p>

                <p>Jonathan Sutton studied maths and computer science at Imperial College as an undergraduate. He has always had a passion for science communication and education. He discovered OneZoom by accident, after attending a lecture given by James on 'mathematical approaches to evolutionary trees'. Since then, he has worked with James' research group on writing code for ecological neutral models. He won a bursary from the Imperial College 'Charity Insights' scheme to work with OneZoom, and focused on improving the website's efficiency on mobile devices. Jonathan made contributions to the OneZoom version 3 codebase. Since his graduation Jonathan now works for Facebook as a professional software developer.</p>
