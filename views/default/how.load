<p><img src="/static/images/Screenshots/scrn1-wide-tree.png">OneZoom displays the full evolutionary tree of life as a fractal, so that every living species can be viewed easily. Each leaf on the tree represents an individual species (colour-coded by conservation status), and branches represent different lineages. The branching points represent points in the history of life where different groups have split from one another, and they are labelled according to when scientists believe this divergence to have occured. General navigation is done by using touch- or click-and-drag to pan the tree, and using a pinch or scroll to zoom.</p><p><img src="/static/images/Screenshots/scrn2-apes.png">Different branches of the tree are labelled with the name of the group that they represent, along with an image of a representative species. You can zoom into a branch of the tree more easily by simply clicking on the thumbnail that labels the branch. For example, here we clicked on the branch labelled <q>Apes</q> in the image above.</p><p><img src="/static/images/Screenshots/scrn3-homo-leaf.png">When the individual leaves become visible, you are able to easily examine any one by touching or clicking on it.</p><p><img src="/static/images/Screenshots/scrn4-popup.png">After zooming in on a leaf or branching point, touching or clicking on it again brings up a window which allows you to view further information about the species or group from a variety of sources, including Wikipedia and the Encyclopedia of Life. There is also an option to sponsor leaves from here, allowing you to have your name displayed on the leaf. OneZoom is a charity and is entirely dependent on the support of its users. More information about sponsoring leaves can be found {{=A("on the OneZoom sponsorship page",_href="http://www.onezoom.org/sponsor.html")}}.</p><p><img src="/static/images/Screenshots/scrn5-options.png">At the top left of the screen, there are also further tools for viewing the tree. The magnifying glass allows you to search for a particular species or group, and the location marker (highlighted in the image) allows you to see where you are in the tree and easily move between levels. The up arrow moves you to the parent node of the group or species you are currently viewing, and the plus and minus signs allow you to zoom in and out without using a scroll or pinch.</p><p>We hope you enjoy exploring the tree of life!</p>
