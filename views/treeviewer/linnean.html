{{#Config settings that will change for different views, e.g. for AT, trail2016, etc. These are stored in the setup_params dictionary
#UI_layer->page        The name of the UI layer view file
#UI_layer->tabs        An array of names of tabs to use (names are in the linkouts() function in tree.py, 
#                       as key names in the url dict) or 'all' for all
#UI_layer->vars->links Can be 'none' for no links, 'newtab' for all links in new tab, or 'default' (or unset) to leave
#popups->vars          Passed to pic_info.load, about.load, how.load, data_sources.load, and the 
#                       internal linkouts urls. You will usually want to define 'embed':1 or 'embed':3.
#                       It's also sensible to set 'form_reservation_code' to a UID so that re-opening sponsor tabs remembers who you are
#partner               (Optional): if it matches a partner_identifier in the partners table, we will automatically fill out 
#                       the popups and UI_layer params to make am automatically created sponsorship site
