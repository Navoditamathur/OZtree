<h2>About the OneZoom tree of life</h2>
<p class='intro'>We hope you have fun exploring the OneZoom tree of life - we've certainly had fun developing it.  Even after thousands of hours working on it, we are still frequently astonished at what it reveals about the world around us. Here are some details about how it all works &mdash;</p>

<h3>Software</h3>
<p>The OneZoom software uses fractals to condense the entire tree of life into a single, zoomable page. OneZoom® is so named because all the information is on a single page: all you have to do is zoom to reveal details. To find out about its gradual development, see our <a href='milestones.html'>timeline</a>. Or find out how you can use OneZoom on your own website, for research or education, by going to our <a href='developer.html'>developer page</a> where a suite of software is available for reuse under an open source MIT license.</p>

<h3>The tree of life</h3>
<p>The data used to construct the tree is from a hand-crafted mix of sources, but relies heavily on the <a href='http://www.opentreeoflife.org'>Open Tree of Life</a> project, to whom we are extremely grateful. For further, extensive information and references, select <q>Data sources<q>. If you are an expert on certain species, we encourage you to <a href='https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/curator'>contribute data</a> to the OpenTree project. </p>

<h3>Images</h3>
<p>Images of species on the tree have been harvested from the internet by the <a href='http://eol.org/'>Encyclopedia of Life</a> project (EoL). We have only selected images that are in the public domain, or released under a <a href='https://creativecommons.org'>creative commons</a> license that <a href='http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/'>allows reuse if the author is credited</a> (and sometimes <a href='https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/'>requires you to make any changes also available</a>). For further information on any image, zoom into the copyright symbol next to the picture. The symbol also serves as a link to the source of the image on EoL. We must thank EoL for their fantastic resource, and helpful responses to our various requests.</p>

<h3>Conservation status</h3>
<p>In the current version, the red leaves of the tree correspond to species that are threatened with extinction according to the <a href='http://www.iucnredlist.org'>IUCN Red List</a> of threatened species. Formally, these species are categorised as <a href='http://www.iucnredlist.org/static/categories_criteria_3_1#categories'>vulnerable, endangered, or critically endangered</a>.</p>

<h3>Sponsorship</h3>
<p>OneZoom is a <a href='static/images/RegistrationCertificate.jpg'>registered charity</a> in the UK. The names of donors to the charity may appear on leaves of the tree. Donations contribute towards the aims of the OneZoom charity, which are to provide easy access to scientific knowledge about biodiversity and evolution, and raise awareness about the variety of life on earth together with the need to conserve it. Our efforts are currently focused on developing this visualization of the tree of life. Please note that donations do not contribute directly to (for example) conservation of a particular species – and neither are species named after sponsors.</p>

<h3>People and thanks</h3>
<p>The current version of software has been developed jointly by Dr James Rosindell, who primarily worked on visualisation and Dr Yan Wong, who primarily worked on synthesising the tree data. Yan is a coauthor with Professor Richard Dawkins on <a href='http://www.ancestorstale.net'><i>The Ancestor's Tale</i></a>: a history of life which has made extensive use of the OneZoom visualisations. The research done for the book has in turn contributed to the dataset used by the OneZoom software. James originally devised the OneZoom concept in 2011 which was published with Dr. Luke Harmon in 2012. Since then Kai Zhong has also had significant input into the OneZoom codebase that this software is based on. More details about the OneZoom software, charity and the many people involved can be found on our <a href='about.html'>about page</a>.</p>
