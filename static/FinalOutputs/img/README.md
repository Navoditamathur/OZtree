The directories in here should correspond to the numbers used in the src_flags dictionary defined in `models/_OZglobals.py`, e.g. ./1 for OneZoom, etc etc. Within these directories, images should be saved in folders based on the last 3 characters of their name, so that e.g. a OneZoom image named `123456.jpg` should be saved in `./1/456/12345.jpg`. For shorter names, the directory can be truncated, so that a OneZoom image named `a.jpg` can be saved in `./1/a/a.jpg`. This splitting up is done so that we don't end up with tens of thousands of images in a single directory, which can impact performance.
