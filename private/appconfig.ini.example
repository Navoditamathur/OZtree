; general params. 
; * maintenance_mins: to enable maintenance mode, set this
;    to the number of minutes you expect the site to be down
; * pics_dir: get thumbnail images from this source. If not
;    defined, will default to the local version, but that
;    means you will need to download >100,000 thumbnail images
;    onto your machine. If you want to use the images on the 
;    OneZoom server, set this to `//images.onezoom.org/`
; * allow_sponsorship. Should we allow the sponsorship page to be 
;    shown on this machine? Usually not allowed, except on the 
;    main OneZoom site (on museum displays people will not want
;    to enter paypal etc details).
